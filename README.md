Our work introduces a novel framework called AVF-BEL (Audiovisual Fusion Brain-like Emotional Learning), which achieves lightweight and interpretable emotional learning and generation through neuroanatomical alignment. The framework integrates key neural structures, including the visual and auditory pathways and emotional circuits, to simulate the brain’s process of audiovisual information fusion and emotional interaction, specifically the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. The AVF-BEL model incorporates modules for visual and auditory processing, audiovisual fusion, and emotional learning, leveraging an improved CORnet-Z model for visual features, a simplified auditory cortex model, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for fusion. It also introduces the Emotional Positivity Parameter (EPP), which reflects emotional positivity through a weighted average and normalization process. The model, evaluated on an audiovisual emotional dataset, demonstrates strong performance with a reduced computational cost, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. By aligning with biological mechanisms, the AVF-BEL model enhances the interpretability of emotional generation, offering a transparent understanding of the decision-making process, thus improving both emotional accuracy and system explainability.
